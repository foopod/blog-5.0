Street Photography. It's not that scary.

And just like every other aspect of photography you can make it your own.

You can focus on the environment.

{% image "./img/12072019-4.jpg", "", "70vw"%}

Or on people.

{% image "./img/12072019-3.jpg", "", "70vw"%}

You can set up your composition and wait.

{% image "./img/12072019-7.jpg", "", "70vw"%}

Or you can walk and shoot.

{% image "./img/12072019-2.jpg", "", "70vw"%}

You can get up close and personal.

{% image "./img/12072019-6.jpg", "", "70vw"%}

Or you can shoot from afar.

{% image "./img/12072019-5.jpg", "", "70vw"%}

You can talk to your subjects and ask for them to pose for you.

{% image "./img/12072019.jpg", "", "70vw"%}

Or you can take your photos discretely

{% image "./img/12072019-1.jpg", "", "70vw"%}

There is one rule though. And this is important...

HAVE FUN!

In all seriousness though, I think I neededed this when I first started doing street photography. It is nice to think about what you can shoot to help build your confidence and get to where you want to go. You have to start somewhere.

description: I learn how to invert a film negative
---

I have been going through my photos and found one that missed the scanner. Why not try to scan it myself?

{% image "./img/2018-05-14-1.jpg", "Photographic Negative of a car in an alleyway, "90vw" "%}

I borrowed a DSLR and took the best shitty photo I could.

{% image "./img/2018-05-14-2.jpg", "Photographic Negative of a car in an alleyway, now with less brown because the colour has been corrected", "90vw" %}

Then using photoshop I used the Eyedropper tool inside Image > Adjustments > Levels to set the white point and the black point of the image.

{% image "./img/2018-05-14-3.jpg", "Photographic Negative of a car in an alleyway, now it looks like a regular photo", "90vw" %}

Then just invert the image and BAM!

description: Getting up at dawn to walk around a new city is always an adventure
---

I'm a morning a person. Every day while I have been in Christchurch for the last two weeks I have been up at dawn, exploring the city in the hours that I can before I have to go to work.

This old school 1950's Studbaker sat on the side of the road.

This is my routine whenever I go to a new city. Spend an hour or two exploring. Then most importantly to the coffee shop.

description: What is a leading lines? Why does it make your photos more interesting?
---

I have been watching more Youtube videos because thats how I learn.

What's this? Leading lines? Make your landscape shots interesting!

Yes please.

The idea is that you create your composition so that elements flow on from each other and draw the observers eyes into the scene.

{% image "./img/2018-05-23-1.jpg", "A path weaving through a forest, trees either side and a clearing in the distance", "70vw" %}

In the example above you can see how the path curves into the distance. It brings attention to the clearing.

{% image "./img/2018-05-23-2.jpg", "A tunnel underneath a bridge that gets smaller and smaller as it goes toward the centre of the frame", "70vw" %}
